These days I'm memorizing English words.
But after I memorize some words, I want to check I can guess the meaning of the words or not. 
So, I want to make some algorithms that can make multiple choices quiz with the synonym of the words.

My vocabulary book includes words, synonym, and Korean meanings. 
So, I'll generate a test randomly with four multiple choices which include only one synonym.

whenever I encounter a quiz, I can type the answer of multiple choices and move on to the next quiz.
after the 15 quizzes, I can check my grade. 

Also, you can updated the list of hard vocabularies for you. 

You can join the voca test in the "with_excel" file.
